<head><title> ORM Lite Package Overview </title></head>
<body>

<p> This package provides a lightweight <a target="_top" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping"
>Object Relational Mapping</a> between Java classes and SQL databases.  There are certainly some <i>much</i> more
mature packages which provide this functionality including <a target="_top" href="https://www.hibernate.org/"
>Hibernate</a> and <a target="_top" href="http://ibatis.apache.org/" >iBatis</a>.  However, I wanted a simple
wrapper around the JDBC functions from the Spring package and Hibernate and iBatis are significantly more
complicated. The package supports natively MySQL, Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, H2, Derby, HSQLDB, and Sqlite.  It
also contains initial, untested support for Oracle and DB2 can be extended to additional ones relatively easily.
Contact the author if your database type is not supported. </p>

<p> See the <a target="_top" href="doc-files/ormlite.html" >documentation</a> for more information. 
There is also a <a target="_top" href="doc-files/ormlite.pdf" >PDF version</a> of the documentation.
The <a target="_top" href="doc-files/changelog.txt" >PDF version</a> shows the various features and bug
fixes in each version. </p>
