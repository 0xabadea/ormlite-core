5) Login to Sontype:    https://oss.sonatype.org/   (graywatson)

8) If there are problems then you will need to drop the release on sonatype.org and re-release:

	mvn -P st release:perform -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite/tags/ormlite-X.X

9) Release to sourceforge in the directory checked out by release:perform.

10) Go to SF and set the default download to the newest jar: https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/explorer.php?group_id=297653

	cd ormlite_web/htdocs/javadoc
	rm -rf * ; unzip ~/frs/releases/com/j256/ormlite/X.X/ormlite-X.X-javadoc.jar

12) Possibly trim the older releases in the release directory.  Try to leave last major release and couple minors.

	cd ~/frs/releases/com/j256/ormlite
	rm -rf 1.11 1.12

13) Run  shutdown  on the sf shell

14) Add a News section to SF with the svn log highlights and subject: released version X.X
