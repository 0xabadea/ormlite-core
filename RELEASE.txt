To release ORMLite:

1) Run all tests -- home and work if possible.

2) Update the release number and date in ormlite.texi.

	cd ~/svn/local/ormlite/src/main/doc/
	make
	mv ormlite.pdf ormlite/* ../javadoc/doc-files

	Svn commit doc files

3) Release to Sonatype: https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide

	mvn -P st release:clean
	mvn -P st release:prepare              (need to type in GPG secret)
	mvn -P st release:perform              (need to type in GPG secret)

4) Login to https://oss.sonatype.org/ (graywatson)

5) Select staging from left nav.

	- Click on com.j256.
	- Right click on the recent open release, pull down to close.  Description: X.X release
	- Right click on closed release and select Promote.  Description: X.X release

	Check Repositories tab -> not-bold Releases -> com -> j256 -> ormlite to see if it is there

6) If there are problems then you will need to drop the release on sonatype.org and re-release:

	mvn -P st release:perform -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite/tags/ormlite-X.X

7) cd to target/checkout which should be the release checked out by release:perform.

	mvn -P sf deploy                       (need to type in GPG secret)

8) Go to SF and set the default download to the newest jar: https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/explorer.php?group_id=297653

9) Create a sf shell.  Explode the javadocs with the newest release:

	create_sf_shell                        (script)
	cd ormlite_web/htdocs/javadoc
	rm -rf * ; unzip ~/frs/releases/com/j256/ormlite/X.X/ormlite-X.X-javadoc.jar

10) Possibly trim the older releases in the release directory.  Try to leave last major release and couple minors.

	cd ~/frs/releases/com/j256/ormlite
	rm -rf 1.11 1.12

11) run  shutdown  on the sf shell

12) Add a News section to SF with the svn log highlights and subject: released version X.X

13) Possibly publish to announcements forum if the release needs more information.

14) Watch to make sure the central repository was updated.
