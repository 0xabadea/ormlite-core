To release ORMLite:

1) Run all tests -- home and work if possible.

	- ormlite-core
	- ormlite-jdbc
	- ormlite-android
	Run ormliteAndroidTests on the simulator as a Android Junit Test
	Run the HelloAndroid and ClickCounter

2) Add section to ~/svn/local/ormlite-core/src/main/javadoc/doc-files/changelog.txt.  Commit it.

3) Add any upgrade notes to ormlite.texi about how to go from version X.X to Y.Y, if necessary

4) Update the release number and date in ormlite.texi.

	cd ~/svn/local/ormlite-core/src/main/doc/
	make install
	cd ..
	svn commit -m 'X.XX docs'

5) Release to Sonatype: https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide

	cd ~/svn/local/ormlite-core
	mvn -P st release:clean
	mvn -P st release:prepare              (need to type in GPG secret)
	mvn -P st release:perform              (need to type in GPG secret)
	
	cd target/checkout   (for -core only)
	mvn install
	
	same for -jdbc and -android
	
	NOTE: if you need to, mvn -P st release:rollback will go back to the starting pom.xml 

6) Login to Sontype:    https://oss.sonatype.org/   (graywatson)

7) Close and release the release:

	- Click on 'Staging Repositories' from left nav
	- Make sure our release is there, is labeled as 'open'.
	- Check off the release.
	- Click on 'close'.  Description: X.X release
	- Check off the now closed release.
	- Click on 'Release'.  Description: X.X release

8) Check to make sure it has been released:
	
	- Click on 'Repositories' from left nav
	- select Releases (not-bold) -> com -> j256 -> ormlite
	- see if the release is there

9) If there are problems then you will need to drop the release on sonatype.org and re-release:

	Core:     mvn -P st release:perform -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite-core/tags/ormlite-core-X.X
	JDBC:     mvn -P st release:perform -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite-jdbc/tags/ormlite-jdbc-X.X
	Android:  mvn -P st release:perform -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite-android/tags/ormlite-android-X.X

10) Release to sourceforge in the directory checked out by release:perform.

	cd ormlite-core/target/checkout
	mvn -P sf deploy                       (need to type in GPG secret)
	
	same for ormlite-jdbc, ormlite-android

11) Go to SF and set the default download to the newest jar: https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/explorer.php?group_id=297653

12) Create a sf shell.  Explode the javadocs with the newest release:

	create_sf_shell							(script)
	sh explode_javadocs.sh					(enter version numbers)

13) Possibly trim the older releases in the release directory.  Try to leave last major release and couple minors.

	cd ~/frs/releases/com/j256/ormlite
	rm -rf 1.11 1.12

14) Run  shutdown  on the sf shell

15) Add a News section to SF with the svn log highlights and subject: released version X.X

16) Possibly publish to announcements forum if the release needs more information.

17) Send mail to users and developers mailing lists about the release:

	- released version X.X
	- show changelog
	- tell them where they can get it

18) Change the pom.xml ormlite-version for new ormlite to X.X-SNAPSHOT in ormlitetest

19) Watch to make sure the central repository was updated.  http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/j256/ormlite/
