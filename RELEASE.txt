To release ORMLite:

1) Run all tests -- home and work if possible.

2) Update the release number and date in ormlite.texi.

	cd ~/svn/local/ormlite/src/main/doc/
	make
	mv ormlite.pdf ormlite/* ../javadoc/doc-files

	Svn commit doc files

3) Add section to ~/svn/local/ormlite/src/main/javadoc/doc-files/changelog.txt.  Commit it.

4) Release to Sonatype: https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide

	mvn -P st release:clean
	mvn -P st release:prepare              (need to type in GPG secret)
	mvn -P st release:perform              (need to type in GPG secret)

5) Login to https://oss.sonatype.org/ (graywatson)

6) Click on 'Staging Repositories' from left nav.

	- Make sure our release is there, is labeled as 'open'.
	- Check off the release.
	- Click on 'close'.  Description: X.X release
	- Check off the now closed release.
	- Click on 'Release'.  Description: X.X release

	Check to make sure it has been released:
	
	- Click on 'Repositories' from left nav
	- select Releases (not-bold) -> com -> j256 -> ormlite
	- see if the release is there

7) If there are problems then you will need to drop the release on sonatype.org and re-release:

	mvn -P st release:perform -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite/tags/ormlite-X.X

8) cd to target/checkout which should be the release checked out by release:perform.

	mvn -P sf deploy                       (need to type in GPG secret)

9) Go to SF and set the default download to the newest jar: https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/explorer.php?group_id=297653

10) Create a sf shell.  Explode the javadocs with the newest release:

	create_sf_shell                        (script)
	cd ormlite_web/htdocs/javadoc
	rm -rf * ; unzip ~/frs/releases/com/j256/ormlite/X.X/ormlite-X.X-javadoc.jar

11) Possibly trim the older releases in the release directory.  Try to leave last major release and couple minors.

	cd ~/frs/releases/com/j256/ormlite
	rm -rf 1.11 1.12

12) run  shutdown  on the sf shell

13) Add a News section to SF with the svn log highlights and subject: released version X.X

14) Possibly publish to announcements forum if the release needs more information.

15) Change the pom.xml version for new ormlite version in ormlitetest.

16) Watch to make sure the central repository was updated.  http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/j256/ormlite/
