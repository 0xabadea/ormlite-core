To release ORMLite:

1) Run all tests -- home and work if possible.

	- ormlite-core
	- ormlite-jdbc
	- ormlite-android

	Run ormliteAndroidTests on the simulator as a Android Junit Test

2) Run Android example programs:

	- Change HelloAndroid, ClickCounter, and NotifyService to use the projects instead of jars
	- run them each on the simulator
	- upgrade their database versions and try again
	- revert their .classpath files

3) Add section to ~/svn/local/ormlite-core/src/main/javadoc/doc-files/changelog.txt.  Commit it.

4) Add any upgrade notes to ormlite.texi about how to go from version X.X to Y.Y, if necessary.

5) Update the version in the ormlite.texi, build/install the docs, commit them.

	cd $HOME/svn/local/ormlite/ormlite-core/src/main/doc
	make install
	cd ..
	svn commit -m 'X.X docs' 

6) Run the release.sh script in -core

	cd $HOME/svn/local/ormlite/ormlite-core
	sh release.sh

	NOTE: if you need to, mvn -P st release:rollback will go back to the starting pom.xml 

7) Login to Sontype:    https://oss.sonatype.org/   (graywatson)

8) Close and release the release:

	- Click on 'Staging Repositories' from left nav

	- Check off the release.
	- Click on 'close'.  Description: X.X release
	- Check off the now closed release.
	- Click on 'Release'.  Description: X.X release

9) Check to make sure it has been released:
	
	- Click on 'Repositories' from left nav
	- select Releases (not-bold) -> com -> j256 -> ormlite
	- see if the release is there

	Core:     mvn -P st release:perform -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite-core/tags/ormlite-core-X.X

10) Go to SF and set the default download to the newest jar:

	https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/explorer.php?group_id=297653

11) Create a sf shell.  Explode the javadocs with the newest release:

	create_sf_shell							(script)
	sh explode_javadocs.sh					(enter version numbers)

12) Possibly trim the older releases in the release directory.  Try to leave last major release and couple minors.

	cd ~/frs/releases/com/j256/ormlite
	rm -rf 1.11 1.12

13) Run  shutdown  on the sf shell

14) Add a News section to SF with the svn log highlights and subject: released version X.X

15) Possibly publish to announcements forum if the release needs more information.

16) Send mail to users and developers mailing lists about the release:

	- released version X.X
	- show changelog
	- tell them where they can get it

17) Change the pom.xml ormlite-version to X.X-SNAPSHOT in ormlitetest

18) Check in new jars into the Android example projects
