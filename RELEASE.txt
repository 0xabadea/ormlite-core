To release ORMLite:

1) Run all tests -- home and work if possible.

	- ormlite-core
	- ormlite-jdbc
	- ormlite-android
	Run ormliteAndroidTests on the simulator as a Android Junit Test
	Run the HelloAndroid and ClickCounter

2) Add section to ~/svn/local/ormlite-core/src/main/javadoc/doc-files/changelog.txt.  Commit it.

3) Add any upgrade notes to ormlite.texi about how to go from version X.X to Y.Y

4) Update the release number and date in ormlite.texi.

	cd ~/svn/local/ormlite-core/src/main/doc/
	make install
	cd ..
	svn commit -m 'X.XX docs'

5) Update the ormlite-version variable in ormlite-android and ormlite-jdbc pom.xml files

	Check-in

6) Release to Sonatype: https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide

	cd ~/svn/local/ormlite-core
	mvn -P st release:clean
	mvn -P st release:prepare              (need to type in GPG secret)
	mvn -P st release:perform              (need to type in GPG secret)
	
	same for -jdbc and -android
	cd ~/svn/local/ormlite-jdbc
	cd ~/svn/local/ormlite-android
	
	NOTE: if you need to, mvn -P st release:rollback will go back to the starting pom.xml 

7) Login to Sontype:    https://oss.sonatype.org/   (graywatson)

8) Close and release the release:

	- Click on 'Staging Repositories' from left nav
	- Make sure our release is there, is labeled as 'open'.
	- Check off the release.
	- Click on 'close'.  Description: X.X release
	- Check off the now closed release.
	- Click on 'Release'.  Description: X.X release

9) Check to make sure it has been released:
	
	- Click on 'Repositories' from left nav
	- select Releases (not-bold) -> com -> j256 -> ormlite
	- see if the release is there

10) If there are problems then you will need to drop the release on sonatype.org and re-release:

	Core:     mvn -P st release:perform -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite-core/tags/ormlite-core-X.X
	JDBC:     mvn -P st release:perform -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite-jdbc/tags/ormlite-jdbc-X.X
	Android:  mvn -P st release:perform -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite-android/tags/ormlite-android-X.X

11) Release to sourceforge in the directory checked out by release:perform.

	cd target/checkout
	mvn -P sf deploy                       (need to type in GPG secret)

12) Go to SF and set the default download to the newest jar: https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/explorer.php?group_id=297653

13) Create a sf shell.  Explode the javadocs with the newest release:

	create_sf_shell                        (script)
	cd ormlite_web/htdocs/javadoc/ormlite-core
	rm -rf * ; unzip ~/frs/releases/com/j256/ormlite/ormlite-core/X.X/ormlite-core-X.X-javadoc.jar
	cd ../ormlite-jdbc
	rm -rf * ; unzip ~/frs/releases/com/j256/ormlite/ormlite-jdbc/X.X/ormlite-jdbc-X.X-javadoc.jar
	cd ../ormlite-android
	rm -rf * ; unzip ~/frs/releases/com/j256/ormlite/ormlite-jdbc/X.X/ormlite-jdbc-X.X-javadoc.jar

14) Possibly trim the older releases in the release directory.  Try to leave last major release and couple minors.

	cd ~/frs/releases/com/j256/ormlite
	rm -rf 1.11 1.12

15) Run  shutdown  on the sf shell

16) Add a News section to SF with the svn log highlights and subject: released version X.X

17) Possibly publish to announcements forum if the release needs more information.

18) Change the pom.xml version for new ormlite to X.X-SNAPSHOT:

	- ormlite-jdbc
	- ormlite-android
	- ormlitetest

19) Watch to make sure the central repository was updated.  http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/j256/ormlite/
