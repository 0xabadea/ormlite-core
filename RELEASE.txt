	- ormlite-core
	- ormlite-jdbc
	- ormliteTest
	- ormliteAndroidTests on the simulator as a Android Junit Test

2) Run Android example programs:

	- Change HelloAndroid, ClickCounter, and NotifyService to use the projects instead of jars
	- run them each on the simulator
	- upgrade their database versions and try again
	- revert their .classpath files

3) Add section to ~/svn/local/ormlite-core/src/main/javadoc/doc-files/changelog.txt.  Commit it.

4) Add any upgrade notes to ormlite.texi about how to go from version X.X to Y.Y, if necessary.

5) Update the version in the ormlite.texi, build/install the docs, commit them.

	cd $HOME/svn/local/ormlite/ormlite-core/src/main/doc
	make install
	cd ..
	svn commit -m 'X.X docs' 

6) Run the release.sh script in -core

	cd $HOME/svn/local/ormlite/ormlite-core
	sh release.sh

	NOTE: if you need to, mvn -P st release:rollback will go back to the starting pom.xml 

7) Login to Sontype:    https://oss.sonatype.org/
