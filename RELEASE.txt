To release ORMLite:

1) Run all tests -- home and work if possible.

	- ormlite-core
	- ormlite-jdbc
	- ormlite-android
	Run ormliteAndroidTests on the simulator as a Android Junit Test

2) Run Android example programs:

	- Change HelloAndroid, ClickCounter, and NotifyService to use the projects instead of jars
	- run them each on the simulator
	- revert their .classpath files

3) Add section to ~/svn/local/ormlite-core/src/main/javadoc/doc-files/changelog.txt.  Commit it.

4) Add any upgrade notes to ormlite.texi about how to go from version X.X to Y.Y, if necessary

5) Update the release number and date in ormlite.texi.

	export RELEASE="3.5"
	cd ~/svn/local/ormlite-core/src/main/doc/
	make install
	cd ..
	svn commit -m "X.XX docs"

6) Release -core to Sonatype: https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide

	svn -m cp delete https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite-core/tags/ormlite-core-$RELEASE
	cd ~/svn/local/ormlite-core
	mvn -P st release:clean
	mvn -P st release:prepare				(need to type in GPG secret)
	mvn -P st release:perform				(need to type in GPG secret)
	
	cd target/checkout
	mvn install

	NOTE: if you need to, mvn -P st release:rollback will go back to the starting pom.xml 

7) Release the -jdbc and -android packages:
	
	svn -m cp delete https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite-jdbc/tags/ormlite-jdbc-X.X
	svn -m cp delete https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite-android/tags/ormlite-android-X.X
	mvn -P st release:clean
	mvn -Dormlite-version=X.X -P st release:prepare				(need to type in GPG secret)
	mvn -P st release:perform									(need to type in GPG secret)
	
	NOTE: if you need to, mvn -P st release:rollback will go back to the starting pom.xml 

8) Login to Sontype:    https://oss.sonatype.org/   (graywatson)

9) Close and release the release:

	- Click on 'Staging Repositories' from left nav
	- Make sure our release is there, is labeled as 'open'.
	- Check off the release.
	- Click on 'close'.  Description: X.X release
	- Check off the now closed release.
	- Click on 'Release'.  Description: X.X release

10) Check to make sure it has been released:
	
	- Click on 'Repositories' from left nav
	- select Releases (not-bold) -> com -> j256 -> ormlite
	- see if the release is there

11) If there are problems then you will need to drop the release on sonatype.org and re-release:

	Core:     mvn -P st release:perform -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite-core/tags/ormlite-core-X.X
	JDBC:     mvn -P st release:perform -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite-jdbc/tags/ormlite-jdbc-X.X
	Android:  mvn -P st release:perform -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:https://ormlite.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ormlite/ormlite-android/tags/ormlite-android-X.X

12) Release to sourceforge in the directory checked out by release:perform.

	cd ormlite-core/target/checkout
	mvn -P sf deploy                       (need to type in GPG secret)
	
	same for ormlite-jdbc, ormlite-android

13) Go to SF and set the default download to the newest jar: https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/explorer.php?group_id=297653

14) Create a sf shell.  Explode the javadocs with the newest release:

	create_sf_shell							(script)
	sh explode_javadocs.sh					(enter version numbers)

15) Possibly trim the older releases in the release directory.  Try to leave last major release and couple minors.

	cd ~/frs/releases/com/j256/ormlite
	rm -rf 1.11 1.12

16) Run  shutdown  on the sf shell

17) Add a News section to SF with the svn log highlights and subject: released version X.X

18) Possibly publish to announcements forum if the release needs more information.

19) Send mail to users and developers mailing lists about the release:

	- released version X.X
	- show changelog
	- tell them where they can get it

20) Change the pom.xml ormlite-version to X.X-SNAPSHOT in ormlitetest

21) run mvneclipce in local to get the new versions right.

22) Watch to make sure the central repository was updated.  http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/j256/ormlite/
